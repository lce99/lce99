I'm currently navigating the exciting seas of the data science field, one statistical model at a time. Specializing in statistics and financial engineering, my interests lie at the crossroads of data science, quants, and financial markets. My motto is "In Data We Trust!" 😄

## 🎓 Education

- 📜 B.S in Statistics, Korea University
- 💰 B.S in Financial Engineering, Korea University
- 📚 Currently pursuing M.S in Statistics, Korea University

## 🏆 Awards

-Honorable Mention, DB 금융경제공모전

Machine Learning and Deep Learning are not just buzzwords for me - I am actively learning and exploring these areas. From Neural Networks to CNNs, I'm on a mission to make machines intelligent (and hopefully not plan a Skynet situation. 🤞).

## 💼 Skills & Experience

As you can see, my toolkit is filled with some pretty neat tools. But let's be honest, they are just tools. The real magic is in how we use them, and I tend to use them to seek the truth in data... and sometimes to create some pretty awesome visualizations too!
